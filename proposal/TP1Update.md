# TP1 Update

Turns out I needed some more stuff to be done before getting two players and sockets working

Finished working on getting extra features necessary for two-player, one computer to work first
Features:
- press space to toggle focus, and move focus without moving troops, as one player cant share the mouse with someone else when on one computer
- fixed all known bugs related to premoves, teleporting troops, and disappearing troops
- fixed all known bugs related to not being able to change focus
